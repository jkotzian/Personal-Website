&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Jake has sleep-walked right out of his house and into the nightmarish forest. Luckily, his bedroom door guardians are determined to lead him back to safety. So grab a friend, and get that little Jakey home!
                <br>
                <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This game was made by myself, Harrison Noh, and Patrick Shin for the Turkey Game Jam hosted by the University of Michigan's game developers club. I did the majority of the programming and Harrison did all of the art. The theme for the competition was "Multiplayer," and we decided that there's not enough co-op games, so we set out to make one! We had 38-hours to make the game, so we limited our scope by deciding on a 2D platforming game. We designed the rest of the game around the gameplay, which we wanted to be unique. We threw around a lot of cooperative gameplay concepts, including throwing each other, stacking, teleporting, asynchronous cooperation, etc. Eventually, we settled on a concept we called a "Portal-style escort mission." By that, we mean that each of the two players have standard platforming controls, and they have to guide an NPC that mindlessly walks around. To help them do this, they can each enter a static "open-portal" mode, where the NPC can walk through one player and teleport out the other.
                <br>
                <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From here, we designed the theme and aesthetic to fit the gameplay. The NPC mindlessly walked around like they were sleep walking, so we went with that. We also thought that players would be more motivated to help a child, so we made the NPC a little boy. From here, we went with a "child dream-like" theme, and having the two players be animated bedroom doors fit that, and it also provided an explanation for how they could teleport Jake. Lastly, we wanted to include my red-headed roommate Jake in on the action and slightly creep him out, and viola! Jake's Nightmare was born (The real-life version of Jake can be seen in the moon).
            <br>
            <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of tools, we wanted to learn some JavaScript, so we decided to make the game in a JavaScript game engine we found online. This turned out to be an awful engine with virtually no documentation, and I had to re-write engine code to get some very basic things to work. Despite the game being buggy because of this, we trudged through the development and it turned out to be pretty fun to play! We were awarded 2nd place amongst 12 teams, and since the competition I've smoothed out a lot of the kinks and added some levels. Enjoy!
